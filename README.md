# Flappy Bird Clone

## Description

This is a clone of the famous Flappy Bird game, built from scratch in two days using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project was both a fun challenge and a great opportunity to explore fundamental game development concepts such as canvas layering, sprite animation, collision detection, parallax scrolling, audio control, and state persistence via `localStorage`.

It’s a compact and approachable example, ideal for understanding how a browser game is structured and functions.

## Objectives

- Recreate a Flappy Bird experience using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Manage multiple canvas layers (UI, game, background).
- Implement gravity, jump mechanics, obstacles, and collision detection.
- Store best scores using localStorage.
- Use parallax scrolling to create background depth.
- Add sound management (toggleable) and keyboard controls.
